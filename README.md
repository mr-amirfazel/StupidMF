- no shell
- no hard to understand archtectue


  create a micro-frontend app using only CDN's
  getting rid of ``` npm install ``` lol :)

  just playing around micro-frontend methodology
  obviously it has its own limitation and its not appropriate for large scale developments
  but still works
  some may call you lazy but trust me its harder than the formal approach
